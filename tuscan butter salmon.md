# Tuscan Butter Salmon

**Ingredients:**

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each), patted dry
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 cups baby spinach
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs (such as basil and parsley), plus more for garnish
- Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the Salmon:**
   - In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil until shimmering but not smoking.
   - Season 4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each) all over with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Place the salmon in the skillet, skin side down, and cook until deeply golden, about 6 minutes.
   - Flip the salmon and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
   - Transfer the salmon to a plate and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 tablespoons of butter to the same skillet.
   - Once the butter has melted, stir in 3 minced cloves of garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
   - Add 1 1/2 cups of halved cherry tomatoes to the skillet; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Cook until the tomatoes begin to burst, then add 2 cups of baby spinach.
   - Cook until the spinach starts to wilt.

3. **Combine and Simmer:**
   - Stir in 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan, and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh herbs (such as basil and parsley).
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer until the sauce slightly reduces, about 3 minutes.

4. **Finish the Dish:**
   - Return the salmon to the skillet and spoon the sauce over the fillets.
   - Let the salmon simmer in the sauce until cooked through, approximately 3 minutes more.

5. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with additional chopped fresh herbs and serve with lemon wedges, if desired.

Enjoy your meal!
