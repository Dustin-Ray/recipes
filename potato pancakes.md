**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the Potato Chunks:**
   - Place the 1 pound of peeled and cut potato chunks into a medium saucepan. Cover with cold water by about 1 inch and add 1 tablespoon of kosher salt.
   - Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender and easily pierced with a fork, approximately 10 minutes.
   - Drain the potatoes and return them to the saucepan. Mash until smooth and set aside to cool slightly.

2. **Prepare the Grated Potatoes:**
   - While the potato chunks are cooking, grate the remaining 1 pound of potatoes using the large holes of a box grater.
   - Transfer the grated potatoes to a clean kitchen towel and wring out as much liquid as possible.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper until well combined.

4. **Mix the Batter:**
   - Add the mashed potatoes and grated potatoes to the bowl with the dry ingredients. [oai_citation_attribution:2‡seriouseats.com](https://www.seriouseats.com/boxty-irish-potato-pancake-recipe-11690806)
   - Pour in 1 cup of buttermilk and add the thinly sliced scallions, if using.
   - Gently fold the mixture together until just combined, being careful not to overmix to avoid tough pancakes.

5. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - In a large nonstick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter over medium heat until foaming subsides.
   - Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, drop 1/4-cup portions of the batter into the skillet, spreading each into a 3-inch round.
   - Cook until the bottoms are golden brown and crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes.
   - Flip the pancakes and continue cooking until the other side is golden brown and the pancakes are cooked through, an additional 3 to 4 minutes.
   - Transfer the cooked pancakes to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet and keep warm in a low oven.
   - Repeat with the remaining batter, adding 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet for each new batch.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the boxty warm with sour cream on the side. [oai_citation_attribution:3‡seriouseats.com](https://www.seriouseats.com/boxty-irish-potato-pancake-recipe-11690806)
